=head1 NAME

List::Ish - List object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $array_ref = [
    {name => 'jkondo'},
    {name => 'cinnamon'}
  ];
  my $list = List::Ish->new($array_ref);

  $list->length;            #=> 2
  my $first = $list->shift; #=> {name => 'jkondo'}
  $list->push($first);      #=> [{name => 'cinnamon'}, {name => 'jkondo'}];

  # List::Ish provides much more useful methods. For more
  # details, see the sections below.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<List::Ish> module provides a class for handling a list (or
array) as an object.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item $list = List::Ish->new ([$item1, $item2, ...])

Construct a list object.  The argument to the C<new> method must be an
array reference or a L<List::Ish> object.  If it is an array
reference, it is blessed with the class.  If it is already blessed
with the class, it is returned as is.

=back

=head1 @{}

Since a L<List::Ish> object is just a blessed array reference, you can
treat is as an array reference in most cases, like:

  my $list = List::Ish->new ([...]);
  for (@$list) {
    ...
  }
  warn $list->[2];

=head1 CLASS METHODS

In addition to just treating the list object as an array reference,
following methods are available to the list object:

=over 4

=item push ( I<@array> )

=item unshift ( I<@array> )

Sets the argument into C<$self>, a refernce to an array blessed by
List::Ish, like the same name functions provided by Perl core,
then returns a List::Ish object.

  my $list = List::Ish->new([qw(1 2 3)]);
  $list->push(4, 5); #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  $list->unshift(0); #=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

=item append ( I<\@array> )

=item prepend ( I<\@array> )

They're almost the same as C<push()>/C<unshift()> described above
except that the argument shoud be a reference to an array.

  my $list = List::Ish->new([1, 2, 3]);
  $list->append([4, 5]); #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  $list->prepend([0]);   #=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

=item shift ()

=item pop ()

Pulls out the first/last element from C<$self>, a refernce to an array
blessed by List::Ish, then returns it like the same name
functions in Perl core.

  $list = List::Ish->new([1, 2, 3]);
  $list->shift; #=> 1
  $list->pop;   #=> 3
  $list->dump   #=> [2]

=item first ()

=item last ()

Returns the first/last element of C<$self>, a refernce to an array
blessed by List::Ish. These methods aren't destructive contrary
to C<shift()>/C<pop()> method.

  $list = List::Ish->new([1, 2, 3]);
  $list->first; #=> 1
  $list->last;  #=> 3
  $list->dump   #=> [1, 2, 3]

=item slice ( I<$start>, I<$end> )

Returns the elements whose indexes are between C<$start> and C<$end>
as a List::Ish object.

  $list = List::Ish->new([qw(1 2 3 4)]);
  $list->slice(1, 2) #=> [2, 3]

=item join ( I<$delimiter> )

Joins all the elements by C<$delimiter>.

  $list = List::Ish->new([0 1 2 3]);
  $list->join(', ') #=> '0, 1, 2, 3'

=item each ( I<$code> )

Executes C<$code> with each value of C<$self>, a refernce to an array
blessed by List::Ish.

  $list = List::Ish->new([1, 2, 3]);
  $list->each(sub { do_something($_) });

=item map ( I<$code> )

Executes C<$code> with each element of C<$self>, a refernce to an
array blessed by List::Ish using CORE::map() and returns the
results as a list or List::Ish object along with the context.

  $list = List::Ish->new([1, 2, 3]);
  $list->map(sub { $_ * 2 }); #=> [2, 4, 6]

=item grep ( I<$code> )

Executes C<$code> with each element of C<$self>, a refernce to an
array blessed by List::Ish using CORE::grep() and returns the
results as a list or List::Ish object along with the context.

  $list = List::Ish->new([qw(1 2 3 4)]);
  $list->grep(sub { ($_ % 2) == 0 }); #=> [2, 4]

=item find ( I<$code> )

Returns the first value found in C<$self>, a refernce to an array
blessed by List::Ish, as a result of C<$code>.

  $list = List::Ish->new([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  $list->find(sub { ($_ % 2) == 0 }); #=> 2

Be careful to use this method if the list can contain false values,
such as C<undef>, zero, and the empty string.  Testing whether the
C<find> method returns true or not is not equivalent to testing
whether there is a value matching the specified condition or not in
those cases.

=item has ( I<$code> )

Returns whether there is one or more list items that matches the
specified condition or not.  The code reference specified as the
argument is invoked with each item in the list, with the C<$_>
variable set to the list item, until the code reference returns true.
The code reference is expected to return whether the list item matches
the desired condition or not.  The code reference may throw an
exception, if desired.  Otherwise, the method return a boolean value,
representing whether there is at least one item that matches the
specified condition or not.

Unlike the C<find> method, this method would return a true value if
the code reference returns a true value, even if the list item was a
false value.

  $list = List::Ish->new([1, undef, 0, 10]);
  ok $list->has(sub { defined $_ and $_ < 1 }); #=> true

=item sort ( I<$code> )

Sorts out each element and returns the result as a list or
List::Ish object along with the context.

  $list = List::Ish->new([qw(3 2 4 1]);
  $list->sort;                          #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
  $list->sort(sub { $_[1] <=> $_[0] }); #=> [4, 3, 2, 1]

=item sort_by ( I<$code>, I<$cmp> )

Sorts out each element with Schwartzian transform returns the result
as a list or List::Ish object along with the context.

  $list = List::Ish->new([ [3], [2], [4], [1]]);
  $list->sort_by(sub { $_->[0] }); #=> [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
  $list->sort_by(sub { $_->[0] }, sub { $_[1} <=> $_[0] } ); #=> [[4], [3], [2], [1]]

=item length ()

Returns the length of C<$self>, a refernce to an array blessed by
List::Ish.

  $list = List::Ish->new([qw(1 2 3 4)]);
  $list->length; #=> 4

This method is equivalent to C<scalar @{$list}> or C<length @{$list}>.

=item size ()

An alias of C<length()> method described above.

=item uniq ()

Uniquifies the elements in C<$self>, a refernce to an array blessed by
List::Ish, and returns the result.

  $list = List::Ish->new([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])
  $list->uniq; #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]

=item reverse ()

Returns an reversely ordered C<$self>, a refernce to an array blessed
by List::Ish.

  $list = List::Ish->new([4, 1, 3, 2])
  $list->reverse; #=> [2, 3, 1, 4]

=item dup ()

Returns a duplicated C<$self>, a refernce to an array blessed by
List::Ish.
